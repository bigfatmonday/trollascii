(22:18:16)    BLACK_MAN › let me introduce you to rufas
(22:18:31)    BLACK_MAN › http://irc.dickscab.com/Rucas/Rucas-newer.jpg
(22:19:59)    BLACK_MAN › how do you feel about his oddly tiny jaw as it starkly contrast to his ghoulishly large mouth
(22:20:33)    BLACK_MAN › also, do his deep-set and beady eyes as they relate to his monstrous aardvark nose evoke any emotions in you?
(22:21:24)    BLACK_MAN › notice how rufas' body is skinny to a skeletal level yet he still sports a pot-belly
(22:21:46)    BLACK_MAN › this is a sign of in-breeding
(22:22:09)    BLACK_MAN › note that his "pinky" finger on his right hand is not muscularly functioning
(22:22:15)    BLACK_MAN › it is unable to grip the bottle as the rest of his fingers do
(22:22:22)    BLACK_MAN › it hands off his hand, slack
(22:22:29)    BLACK_MAN › this is a genetic muscular defect
(22:22:31)    BLACK_MAN › most likely also a result of inbreeding
(22:22:50)    BLACK_MAN › also note where his shirt clings to his chest near the nipple region
(22:22:53)    BLACK_MAN › this denotes gynecomastia
(22:23:37)    BLACK_MAN › take note of his skeletal proportions
(22:24:15)    BLACK_MAN › you see, a major characteristic of estrogenic skeletal anatomy is wide, child bearing hips
(22:24:28)    BLACK_MAN › men generally sport on average, a 1.5:1 shoulder:hip ratio
(22:24:46)    BLACK_MAN › rufas' 1:1 shoulder:hip ratio tells us that clearly he is suffering primary hypogonadism
(22:24:58)    BLACK_MAN › most likely prebuscent primary hypogonadism since it has effected his skeletal development
